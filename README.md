# Bangazon Front End
This is the client for my first full stack app! Bangazon is an e-commerce platform for users to buy and sell items.

## About the User
- A user can be a seller, a buyer, or both.
- The ideal user is someone who wants to make extra cash posting items for sale, or wants to buy from small vendors
- The app connects sellers and buyers in a virtual marketplace of authenticated users
  
## Features
- Users are authenticated with Firebase and registered to the database created with PostgreSQL and Entity Framework
- Users can see and edit their user profile, and see their order history
- Users who are sellers can view their store, as well as their sales and customers
- When a user logs in, their cart (order) is created
- They can add and remove products from their cart and close the order by submitting a payment form
- Upon completion of the order in their cart, a new "cart" is created, ensuring only one order can be open at a time
- Shoppers can view products by category and view products in sellers' stores
- Users can search for sellers, buyers and products
- Full CRUD on user entity
